## Empirical Evaluations

### Compatibility of SODEF:

### In this section, we show compatibility of SODEF using [TRADES](https://github.com/P2333/Bag-of-Tricks-for-AT/):

We append our SODEF after TRADES net to improve the model robustness against adversarial attacks. TRADES works as the feature extractor <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=h_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}"> as in our paper. Please note TRADES weights are kept fixed during the training. We use the pretrained model provided by [TRADES Repo](https://github.com/P2333/Bag-of-Tricks-for-AT/).

[AutoAttack](https://github.com/fra31/auto-attack) on adversarial CIFAR10 examples with ℒ<sub>2</sub> norm
(*ϵ* = 0.5) and ℒ<sub>∞</sub> norm (*ϵ* = 8/255).

__Transfer attack__:

Classification accuracy for adv examples generated from original [pretrained model](https://github.com/P2333/Bag-of-Tricks-for-AT/) using AA ℒ<sub>∞</sub> (*ϵ* = 8/255) attacks : 61.94%.

### In this section, we show compatibility of SODEF using [Rebuffi2021](https://github.com/deepmind/deepmind-research/tree/master/adversarial_robustness):


Similar to the above section, we append SODEF after the pretrained model provided by the [RobustBench](https://github.com/RobustBench/robustbench) with keywords "Rebuffi2021Fixing_70_16_cutmix_extra". The weights are kept fixed during the training except the final FC layer. The pretrained model without SODEF achieves 66.58% accuracy under AutoAttack. We show that with SODEF, the robust accuracy could be improved to over 70%:

Here again for the transfer attack, adv examples are generated from original pretrained model using AA ℒ<sub>∞</sub> (*ϵ* = 8/255) attacks. We will report results under each individual attack as in Tab 1. soon.

cd Rebuffi2021Fixing_70_16_cutmix_extra

### Notification
It seems git lfs is not working very well. The checkpoints can also be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1i7Cj-dvY-7LJWNKACsJDQZmyKiAlCEI9?usp=sharing). More test code and models will be uploaded soon after packing.

We currenly only upload the test code for SODEF. Please understand we have strict protocols for code release as this research is partially funded by corporate funding. We will upload the training code as soon as permission is granted.
